## a. **Define Security Architecture**
Security architecture in 5G ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services. It integrates end-to-end encryption, authentication, and secure key management. It addresses threats in access, core, and user planes. The architecture evolves to support emerging technologies like IoT and network slicing.

## b. **Classify Multiple Access Schemes**
Multiple access schemes allow multiple users to share the same communication resources:
1. **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**: Assigns separate frequencies to users.
2. **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**: Divides access by time slots.
3. **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**: Uses unique codes for user separation.
4. **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)**: Allocates subcarriers to users in 5G.

## c. **Sketch CP Design in 5G NR**
Cyclic Prefix (CP) in 5G NR prevents inter-symbol interference (ISI) in multipath environments:
- CP is a copy of the last part of an OFDM symbol, appended to its beginning.
- It creates a guard interval to absorb delay spreads.
- CP length is optimized based on channel conditions and numerology for efficient performance.

---

## d. **Describe Logical Channels for NR**
Logical channels in NR define the type of information being transmitted:
- **Control Channels**: Carry signaling and network information, e.g., BCCH.
- **Traffic Channels**: Handle user data like voice or video, e.g., DTCH.
- Logical channels are mapped to transport and physical layers for efficient data flow.

---

## e. **State the Channel Mapping**
Channel mapping in 5G organizes the flow of data:
- Logical channels (purpose-driven) map to transport channels (delivery method).
- Transport channels are further mapped to physical channels (radio resources).
- This hierarchical mapping ensures efficient resource utilization and seamless communication.

## **Define Radio Access Network**
The Radio Access Network (RAN) connects user devices to the core network, facilitating wireless communication. It includes base stations, antennas, and other infrastructure to manage signal transmission and reception. In 5G, RAN supports advanced features like massive MIMO, beamforming, and network slicing.

---

## **State the Cyclic Prefix OFDM**
Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) adds a guard interval (CP) to OFDM symbols to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) in multipath environments. The CP, a replica of the symbol's end, absorbs delays and ensures orthogonality in frequency-domain transmissions.

## **Classify Multiple Access Schemes**
1. **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**: Allocates unique frequencies to users.  
2. **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**: Assigns time slots for user access.  
3. **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**: Uses unique spreading codes for separation.  
4. **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)**: Allocates subcarriers dynamically, enabling efficient use of spectrum in 5G.

---

## **State the Channel Mapping**
Channel mapping organizes data flow between different channel types:
- **Logical Channels**: Define the purpose of data (e.g., control, traffic).  
- **Transport Channels**: Specify how data is delivered (e.g., BCH, SCH).  
- **Physical Channels**: Allocate radio resources for transmission.  
This mapping ensures seamless and efficient communication across network layers.

---

## **Define Channel Hierarchy**
The channel hierarchy in 5G organizes channels into three levels:
1. **Logical Channels**: Focus on data type and purpose.  
2. **Transport Channels**: Handle data transmission methods.  
3. **Physical Channels**: Manage the radio interface and resource allocation.  
This structured design simplifies data handling and enhances system efficiency.
