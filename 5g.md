# Cellular Systems Overview
Cellular systems divide a large area into smaller cells to improve signal coverage and manage a large number of users. 

* **Base Stations:** Communicate with mobile devices within each cell.
* **Cell Division:** Reuses frequencies across different cells to avoid interference and improve efficiency.

## Basics of New Radio (NR)
New Radio (NR) is the wireless communication standard for 5G networks, offering:

* Higher speeds
* Lower latency
* Flexible bandwidth
* Massive connectivity

## Next Generation Core Network
The next-generation core network brings:

* Network slicing
* Cloud-native architecture
* Enhanced security

## Mobile Network Technologies

* **2G (GSM):** Basic voice calls and text messages.
* **3G (UMTS):** Faster data speeds for browsing and multimedia.
* **4G (LTE):** High-speed internet for video calls, streaming, and downloads.
* **5G:** Ultra-high-speed data, low latency, and massive connectivity.

## Network Softwarization and Slicing
* **Network Softwarization:** Using software to control network functions, making them more flexible and cost-efficient.
* **Network Slicing:** Creating multiple virtual networks on the same physical infrastructure for different types of traffic.

## Cell Clustering
Grouping cells together to improve coverage and performance, especially in dense urban areas.

## Physical Infrastructure Improvements
* Small cells
* Massive MIMO
* Fiber optics

## Enabling Technologies
* Millimeter waves
* Edge computing
* Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Multi-Tenancy Support
Allowing multiple customers to share the same physical infrastructure while keeping their services isolated and secure.
