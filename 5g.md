The physical layer of 5G NR transmits actual data over the air interface:
- **Key Physical Channels**:
  - **Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)**:
    - Carries basic system information for device access.
  - **Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)**:
    - Main channel for downlink user data.
  - **Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)**:
    - Main channel for uplink user data.
  - **Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)**:
    - Transmits control information from the device to the network.
- **Features**:
  - Flexible numerology and beamforming for efficient communication.
  - Supports high-speed, low-latency data transmission.
